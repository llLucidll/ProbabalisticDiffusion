Implemented as seen in Song et al. 

1. A lightweight Unet model with time embeddings for use with both Probabalistic and Deterministic Diffusion Models. Able to obtain 95+ accuracy on FashionMNIST generation

2. Lightweight conditional VAE architecture with large latent space able to generalize well to FashionMNIST in just one epoch of training obtaining accuracies of 90+
